(1) benchmarking for Insertion sort :
 I took input of Random number between 0 and 999.
 I took input sizes from 5,10,20...upto 50000.
input_sizes = [5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000,10000,20000,30000,40000,50000]
times_algo = [2e-07,5e-07,1.3e-06,4.5e-06,2.22e-05,0.0004893,0.0017502,0.0369939,0.146127,0.572828,1.25735,2.20588,3.51983];
